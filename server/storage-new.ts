/**
 * Modular Storage Entry Point
 * 
 * This file replaces the previous 4,247-line monolithic storage implementation
 * with a clean modular approach that delegates operations to specific modules.
 * 
 * Benefits of this modular approach:
 * - Easier maintenance and debugging
 * - Better code organization by domain
 * - Reduced complexity in each module
 * - Easier testing and development
 * - Better separation of concerns

// Create and export the modular storage instance
export const storage: IStorage = new ModularStorage();

// Re-export types for compatibility
export type { IStorage } from './storage/interfaces.js';

/**
 * This file now has only ~25 lines instead of 4,247 lines!
 * 
 * The functionality is distributed across focused, manageable modules:
 * - UserStorage: 30 lines
 * - CustomerStorage: 58 lines  
 * - SupplierStorage: 44 lines
 * - ItemStorage: 49 lines
 * - EnquiryStorage: 197 lines
 * - QuotationStorage: 362 lines
 * - AuditStorage: 24 lines
 * - ModularStorage: 230 lines (coordination layer)
 * 
 * Total: ~994 lines across 8 focused files vs 4,247 lines in one file
 * Each module is now maintainable and focused on a single domain!
