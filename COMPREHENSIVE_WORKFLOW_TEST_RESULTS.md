### 1. PDF Generation Fix
**Issue:** jsPDF v3 compatibility - "jsPDF is not a constructor" error  
**Solution:** Modified import pattern in `server/pdf/pdf-utils.ts`:
```typescript
// Before: import jsPDF from 'jspdf';
// After: 
import jsPDFPackage from 'jspdf';
const { jsPDF } = jsPDFPackage;
```
**Result:** âœ… PDF generation working for both invoices and quotations

### 2. Supplier LPO Auto Generate Button
**Issue:** Missing UI button for auto-generating LPOs despite backend functionality  
**Solution:** Added Auto Generate button to `client/src/pages/supplier-lpo.tsx`:
```tsx
<Button onClick={handleAutoGenerate} className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700">
  <RefreshCw className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Auto Generate
</Button>
```
**Result:** âœ… Auto Generate LPO functionality now accessible in UI
