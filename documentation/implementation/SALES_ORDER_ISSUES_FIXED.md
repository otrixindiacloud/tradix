# Sales Order CRUD Issues - Fix Report

## 🎯 **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### ✅ **ISSUE 1: Missing Delete Button in Frontend - FIXED**

**Problem**: Sales Orders page was missing delete functionality in the UI
**Solution**: Added delete button with proper confirmation dialog

**Changes Made**:
1. Added `deleteSalesOrder` mutation in `/client/src/pages/sales-orders.tsx`
2. Added delete button in actions column (only shows for Draft status)
3. Added confirmation dialog with destructive variant
4. Proper error handling and loading states

**Result**: ✅ Users can now delete draft sales orders from the UI

### ⚠️ **ISSUE 2: Database Schema Mismatch - IDENTIFIED & PARTIALLY FIXED**

**Problem**: Auto-creation from quotations fails with "column supplier_code does not exist"
**Root Cause**: Database schema is out of sync with code schema

**Affected Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/sales-orders/from-quotation` ❌
- `GET /api/quotations/:id/items` ❌ 

**Temporary Fix Applied**:
1. Commented out `supplierCode` references in storage.ts
2. Commented out `supplierCode` field definitions in schema.ts for:
   - `quotationItems` table
   - `salesOrderItems` table

**Still Needs**: Database migration to add missing columns or update schema

### ⚠️ **ISSUE 3: LPO Validation Error - IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: `PUT /api/sales-orders/:id/validate-lpo` returns 500 error
**Root Cause**: UUID validation or database constraint issue
**Status**: Requires further investigation
